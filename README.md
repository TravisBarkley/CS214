Assignments from CS 214 Software Development 

I took this class during the Fall 2023 Semester, my first semester of my second year. 
This class was brand new the semester I took it and went as expected. 
The purpose of the class was to constantly develop the same code throughout a semester. 
This class covered coverage testing, unit testing, logging, and general OOP. 

Honestly the quality of the assignments decrease as we go down as the class requirements became less clear and it was more about "beating the autograder"
